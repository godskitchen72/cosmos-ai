### Admin page refactor — complete

Pure structural refactor of `app/admin/page.tsx` (2,761 lines → 114-line
shell). Zero behavioral changes. All 8 tabs confirmed working in production.

**New file structure:**

```
app/admin/
  page.tsx                    ← shell only, 114 lines
  shared.tsx                  ← shared helpers, components, constants (264 lines)
  components/
    OverviewSection.tsx        (543 lines)
    CarriersSection.tsx        (320 lines)
    DoctorsSection.tsx         (803 lines)
    LawyersSection.tsx         (186 lines)
    CptCodesSection.tsx        (424 lines)
    Icd10Section.tsx           (310 lines)
    UsersSection.tsx           (306 lines)
    AuditLogSection.tsx        (257 lines)
```

**`shared.tsx`** exports all cross-section utilities: `getAuthToken`,
`PDF_API_URL`, `formatPhone`, `Field`, `SectionHeading`, `STATES`,
`StateSelectField`, `SignaturePad`, `TAX_CLASS_OPTIONS`, `LLC_CLASS_OPTIONS`,
`SPECIALTY_OPTIONS`, `LICENSE_TYPE_OPTIONS`, `BLANK_DOCTOR`, `PROVIDER_TYPES`.

**Preserved intact:** `useMemo` on `filtered` in `AuditLogSection` (prevents
TanStack Table infinite re-render freeze). `admin-tab` custom event listener
in shell `page.tsx`. All handler logic byte-for-byte identical to original.

## 2026-07-05 — Session 18 prep / Session 17 final

### Audit Log — full implementation (Enterprise Hardening Stage 2 complete)

**Migration 023:** `audit_logs` table with indexes and RLS (authenticated
SELECT + INSERT).

**DB triggers** — `log_audit_event()` PLPGSQL function on 7 tables:
`patients`, `patient_visits`, `visit_line_items`, `doctors`,
`insurance_carriers`, `user_profiles`, `practice_settings`. Captures
old/new data as jsonb. User attribution shows "System" — no PostgreSQL
session context available in trigger functions.

**`app/lib/auditLogger.ts`** — new shared helper. `writeAuditLog()` reads
current session user + role from `user_profiles`, inserts attributed entry
into `audit_logs`. Never throws — audit failures must not break main flow.

**Frontend audit calls added to:**
- `app/page.tsx` — login success, login failed (with attempts remaining),
  MFA verified
- `app/patients/[patientId]/PatientProfile.tsx` — NF-2/AOB generated,
  NF-3 preflight confirmed, submitted to billing
- `app/billing/BillerDashboard.tsx` — NF-3 generated, claim status changed,
  received amount updated, MD flagged
- `app/md/[patientId]/PatientChart.tsx` — visit created/updated, flag
  accepted, flag rejected

**Admin Audit Log tab** — new tab in Admin panel. shadcn/TanStack Table,
last 500 entries newest-first, category filter chips, search, pagination.
Fixed freeze: `useMemo` on filtered data (non-memoized array passed to
`useReactTable` caused infinite re-render on filter chip tap).

---

## 2026-07-05 — Session 17 (final)

### MFA for admin/billing/superadmin

TOTP-based MFA via Supabase Auth for `admin`, `billing`, `superadmin` roles.

**Migration:** `practice_settings.mfa_required boolean DEFAULT false`.

**`app/page.tsx`** — After PIN login, checks `mfa_required` setting. If enabled and device not trusted: checks TOTP enrollment → shows setup screen (QR code + manual key entry) or challenge screen (6-digit code). On successful verify, stores 30-day device trust token in `localStorage`. Trusted devices skip MFA for 30 days.

**`app/admin/page.tsx`** — New **Security & Access** section on Overview tab, separated from Practice Info. Contains MFA toggle and Session Timeout selector with dedicated "Save Security Settings" button. Toast confirmation on save. "Reset MFA" button added to admin/billing/superadmin user cards in Users tab.

**`app/api/admin/users/route.ts`** — Added `reset_mfa: true` PATCH handler — unenrolls all TOTP factors for the user via Supabase Admin API.

### FD dashboard queue subtitle updates

- "All Missing Forms": "NF-2 or AOB missing; or NF-3 preflight not completed"
- "NF-3 — 45 Day Deadline": "Biller must generate NF-3 within 45 days of service date"

### Security & Access section — admin Overview tab

MFA toggle and Session Timeout moved from Practice Info form into dedicated Security & Access card. Each section now saves independently with appropriate confirmation feedback.

---

## 2026-07-05 — Session 17 (continued)

### PIN attempt lockout (`app/page.tsx`)

Failed PIN attempt lockout implemented. Enterprise Hardening Stage 2 item complete.

**Migration:** `login_attempts` table (`id`, `email`, `attempted_at`, `success`).
Index on `email`. RLS: `authenticated` + `anon` full access (anon required —
lockout check runs before the user is authenticated).

**Logic:** On each login attempt, queries failures since the last success for
that email within a 15-minute window. 5+ failures → account locked, shows
minutes remaining. Each failed attempt inserts a row and re-fetches the count
to show accurate "X attempts remaining" message. Successful login inserts a
success row, resetting the effective failure count. Lockout auto-expires after
15 minutes — no admin action needed.

**Known issue during development:** Initial deploy used `authenticated`-only
RLS, causing all anon inserts/selects to silently fail (RLS returns empty with
no error), making counter always show MAX_ATTEMPTS. Fixed by adding `anon`
full-access policy.

### FD dashboard queue subtitle updates (`DashboardClient.tsx`)

- "All Missing Forms" subtitle: "NF-2 or AOB missing; or NF-3 preflight not completed"
- "NF-3 — 45 Day Deadline" subtitle: "Biller must generate NF-3 within 45 days of service date"
- NF-3 queue empty state: "All NF-3s generated by biller on time"

## 2026-07-05 — Session 17

### NF-3 workflow redesign — full implementation

**Product decision:** NF-3 generation moves from FD to Biller. FD becomes
validation-only via a preflight check.

**Migrations:**
- `020`: `patient_visits.nf3_preflight_passed boolean DEFAULT false` +
  `biller_md_flags` table (visit_id, patient_id, flagged_by, flag_reason,
  flag_note, resolved_at) + RLS
- `021`: `biller_md_flags.suggested_cpt_codes text[]`,
  `suggested_icd10_codes text[]`
- `022`: `biller_md_flags.resolution text`, `rejection_note text`,
  `biller_dismissed_at timestamptz`

**`PatientProfile.tsx`** — NF-3 card replaced with preflight modal. Checks
8 required fields (signature, carrier, claim #, policy #, DOI, attorney, CPT,
ICD-10). "Confirm Ready" writes `nf3_preflight_passed = true`. Submission
gate updated: `hasNf3` → `nf3_preflight_passed`. NF-3 generation handlers
removed.

**`BillerDashboard.tsx`** — `+ NF-3` badge generates NF-3 per visit; flips
to tappable `NF-3` when generated. `⚑ Flag MD` button opens `FlagMdModal`
with simplified reasons (Missing/Incorrect CPT, Missing/Incorrect ICD-10)
and full code library pickers. Suggested codes shown in amber (⏳) in CPT
and ICD-10 columns. Rejected flags show `↩ MD Rejected` with Dismiss ×
button. `dismissFlag` callback writes `biller_dismissed_at`.

**`billing/page.tsx`** — Added `cpt_codes` and `icd10_codes` fetches.
`biller_md_flags` query updated to fetch pending + rejected-undismissed
flags. Added `resolution`, `rejection_note`, `biller_dismissed_at` to select.

**`MDClient.tsx`** — Persistent amber flag alert card at top of dashboard.
Shows patient, visit date, reason, note, suggested CPT and ICD-10 codes.
Navigation URL includes `?visit_id=` so PatientChart loads in UPDATE mode
for the flagged visit.

**`PatientChart.tsx`** — Biller flag strip rendered when `visit_id` URL
param matches an open flag. Shows suggested codes. Accept & Apply pre-fills
code pickers (additive). Reject writes `resolved_at + resolution: rejected +
rejection_note`. Auto-resolves as `accepted` when visit saves after accept.

### IcdReferral.tsx — Authorization header fix

`app/md/[patientId]/icd10/IcdReferral.tsx` was missing `getAuthToken()` and
`Authorization: Bearer` header. Both added. All other referral screens
confirmed correct.

### Biller docs column layout

Docs column badges (NF-3, AOB, PCE, W9, Flag MD) now render in a single
horizontal `nowrap` row. Final fix uses inline `style={{ flexWrap:'nowrap' }}`
after Tailwind `flex-col`/`flex-row` classes were pruned by the build.

---

## 2026-07-05 — Session 16

### Documentation update only

No code written or deployed this session.

Updated documents:
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Session 15 entries added (dev tools rebuild + W9 supervisor-chain fix)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Migrations 017–019 added to §3 migration list; §10 login flow updated to reflect Session 14 fix (location picker now always shown for MD/PA/NP regardless of location count)
- `HANDOVER.md` — Session 15 → Session 16

---

## 2026-07-04 — Session 15

### Dev Tools — full rebuild (`app/dev/page.tsx`)

Complete rewrite of the dev data generator. All features confirmed
working in production:

- **Real doctors, carriers, lawyers** from live database tables
- **Visit count selector** — None / 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 visits per patient;
  each visit dated randomly across recent weeks
- **DOI guard** — visit dates clamped to always be after the patient's DOI
- **Live CPT codes** — fetched from `cpt_codes` table, random-sampled per
  visit; fallback to hardcoded sets if table is empty
- **Max MD mode** — samples up to 8 codes from the live pool instead of 3–6
- **Individual referral selector** — None / All 9 shortcut chips plus
  individual toggles for each of the 9 referral types (MRI, VNG, Rx, DME,
  ANS, ICD-10, PT, Ortho, Pain Mgmt)
- **Per-patient Render warm-up** — `/health` ping before each patient's
  referral batch eliminates cold-start fetch failures between patients
- **1.2s delay between referral calls** — prevents Render from dropping
  sequential connections
- **Chip component** — extracted as a proper React component with explicit
  color/border/background on both active and inactive states (fixes
  preflight-gap dark text bug)
- **Results panel** — color-coded by indent level: patient (green), visit
  (orange), referral OK (bright green), error (red), done (cyan)

### Billing — W9 supervisor-chain fix (`BillerDashboard.tsx`, `billing/page.tsx`)

**Root cause:** W9 badge used `patient.doctor_id → doctor.w9_url` join.
Supervised providers (PA, NP) have no `w9_url` — their billing entity
is the supervising MD. Join returned null, showing grey W9 badge even
when the supervisor's W9 existed.

**Fix:**
- `billing/page.tsx` — `supervising_provider_id` added to doctors select
- `BillerDashboard.tsx` — `Doctor` interface updated; `rows` useMemo
  computes `resolvedW9` (`own w9_url → supervisor's w9_url` fallback),
  exposes it as `doctorWithW9` on each `RowData` row; W9 `DocBadge`
  reads `doctorWithW9?.w9_url`

## 2026-07-04 — Session 14

### CPT import — many-to-many ICD-10 mapping

CPT CSV importer now handles multi-ICD-10 rows per CPT code correctly:

- Deduplicates CPT rows by `cpt_code` before upsert (fixes
  silent batch failure with multi-ICD-10 CSVs)
- Upserts ICD-10 codes to `icd10_codes` (deduplicated by `code`)
- Upserts mappings to `cpt_icd10_map` on `(cpt_code, icd10_code)` —
  idempotent, re-import safe
- Full `toastError` on all three upsert operations
- Success toast confirms CPT, ICD-10, and mapping counts

**RLS fix:** `icd10_codes` missing `authenticated` INSERT/UPDATE policy —
discovered via new error surfacing. Fixed with full `ALL` policy.

### CPT import — Download Template link

"⬇ Download Import Template" link added below Import CSV button in
`CptCodesSection`. Client-side blob URL, no server dependency.

---

## 2026-07-04 — Session 13

### `forms/mri.py` — full backend audit

Obtained and audited for the first time. All Session 12 frontend keys
confirmed correctly wired. No backend changes required.

### MRI Spine order fix

`MRI_SPINE` array reordered to clinical standard:
Cervical → Thoracic → Lumbar (was Cervical → Lumbar → Thoracic).

### CosmosUI standard — fully adopted app-wide

All remaining referral screens migrated:
- `DmeReferral.tsx` — `cosmosConfirm`, `AlertModal`/`ConfirmModal` mounted
- `OrthoReferral.tsx`, `PainMgmtReferral.tsx`, `VngReferral.tsx`,
  `RxReferral.tsx`, `PtReferral.tsx`, `AnsReferral.tsx` — `cosmosConfirm`,
  `AlertModal`/`ConfirmModal` mounted, `toastError` replacing inline error divs
- `app/calendar/page.tsx` — `cosmosConfirm`, `AlertModal`/`ConfirmModal` mounted

`SessionTimeoutModal` added to `CosmosUI.tsx`.

Native `alert()`/`confirm()` now eliminated app-wide.

### Enterprise Hardening Stage 2 — API JWT authentication

All 15 `cosmos-api` POST endpoints protected with `verify_jwt` FastAPI
dependency. Calls Supabase `/auth/v1/user` to verify Bearer token.
Returns HTTP 401 for unauthenticated requests.

- `cosmos-api/main.py`: `verify_jwt` function, `Depends` on all 15 routes
- `cosmos-api/requirements.txt`: `httpx` added
- Render env: `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` added
- All frontend `cosmos-api` fetch calls: `Authorization: Bearer` header added
  via `getAuthToken()` helper injected into every calling file

### Enterprise Hardening Stage 2 — Session timeout

Inactivity-based auto sign-out implemented.

- `app/hooks/useSessionTimeout.ts`: new hook
- Migration 019: `practice_settings.session_timeout_minutes int NOT NULL DEFAULT 15`
- Admin panel: Session Timeout selector added to Practice Settings
- Superadmin exempt: `'0'` written at login, hook disabled for that session
- Mounted on: `DashboardClient.tsx`, `MDClient.tsx`, `admin/page.tsx`,
  `BillerDashboard.tsx`

### `forms/dme.py` — backend audit

Obtained and audited. All frontend keys confirmed correctly wired.

### Patch script cleanup

All accumulated `~/patch_*.py`, `~/remove_*.py`, `~/wire_*.py`,
`~/write_*.py` scripts from previous sessions deleted.

---

# Cosmos Medical Technologies — CHANGELOG

Append-only. Entries in reverse chronological order. Never renumber,
never delete. Each entry records only what actually shipped — not what
was planned or considered.

---

## 2026-07-04 — Session 12

### Enterprise Hardening — RLS full audit and hardening

Full audit of all RLS policies. All `anon` and `public` policies removed
from every table. Every table now locked to `authenticated` only.

Verified: 0 rows returned by anon/public policy query post-migration.

### Enterprise Hardening — NOT NULL constraints (migration 018)

- `doctors.license_number NOT NULL`
- `doctors.npi NOT NULL`
- `doctors.mailing_state NOT NULL`
- `patient_forms.form_type NOT NULL`

### NF-3 regression fix — place of service + description of treatment

`main.py`: Place of service falls back to MD's assigned `doctor_locations`
when `visit.location_id` is null. `database.py`: Dead doctor address column
references removed.

### MRI Referral — extremity studies, contrast, metal implant gate

Full rebuild of `MriReferral.tsx`: metal implant toggle, extremity studies
table, contrast selector, insurance auto-read.

### CPT codes filtered by provider license type

`fetchLicenseType()` at login; `filteredCptCodes` in `PatientChart.tsx`.

### CosmosUI — universal notification standard

New file: `app/components/ui/CosmosUI.tsx`. Exports: `toastSuccess()`,
`toastError()`, `toastInfo()`, `cosmosConfirm()`, `ToastContainer`,
`AlertModal`, `ConfirmModal`.

---

## 2026-07-04 — Session 11

### NF-3 — Patient signature gate

NF-3 generate locked until `patient_signature_url` is on file.

### W9 — entity-based scoping rule

W9 applies only to: `!supervising_provider_id AND (!!pc_corp_name OR tax_classification === 'individual')`.

### NF-3 — supervisor W9 routing for supervised providers

After doctor merge, supervisor's W9 injected into `patient_data` when
`supervising_provider_id` is set.

### NF-3 Section 16 — license number replaces NPI

`treating_provider.1.license_or_certification_number` now uses
`doctor_license_number`, not NPI.

### AOB — always uses billing entity

Provider name/address/signature all resolve to billing entity per priority
chain.

---

## 2026-07-03 — Session 10

### `forms/base.py` — removed all `except Exception: pass`

### `w9_filler.py` removed
