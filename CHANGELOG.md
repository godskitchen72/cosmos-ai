# Changelog

## 2026-06-30 — Mailing address, tab merge, PA/NP, grouped provider cards, dev tools fixes

### Migration 014 — mailing address replaces PC/personal address

Dropped from `doctors`: `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `pc_street`,
`pc_city`, `pc_state`, `pc_zip`. Added: `mailing_street`, `mailing_city`,
`mailing_state` (DEFAULT `'NY'`), `mailing_zip`. Mailing address is required
for all providers regardless of tax classification — it is where insurance
companies send payments, denials, and correspondence.

### `forms/w9.py` — reads `mailing_*` columns

Dropped old fallback chain (`pc_street → street`). W-9 address lines now
read `mailing_street`, `mailing_city`, `mailing_state`, `mailing_zip` directly.

### Provider form — General + Credentials tab merge

`General` tab removed. Fields merged into `Credentials` tab:
First/Last Name, License Type, Specialty, Supervising Provider, Email,
Phone, Fax, NPI, License #, Signature. Provider form now has three tabs:
**Credentials** · **Billing** · **Schedule**.

### Billing tab — Mailing Address replaces Registered PC Address

`Registered PC Address` block removed from Billing tab. New **Mailing Address**
block (Street/City/State/Zip) added — always visible regardless of tax
classification. PC Corp Name remains, still conditionally shown for non-individual
tax classifications. Validation: all four mailing address fields are required.

### PA and NP license types

`LICENSE_TYPE_OPTIONS` extended: `NP — Nurse Practitioner`,
`PA — Physician Assistant`. Validation: `license_type === 'NP'` requires
`supervising_provider_id` (NPs must work under a supervising MD). PAs can
have their own PC with no supervisor.

### Provider cards — grouped hierarchy + visual tiers

Doctor list now groups by billing hierarchy: independent/supervising MDs
first (full cyan border), supervised providers indented under their
supervisor (dim border, `ml-4`). Card content: name + inline license
abbreviation, specialty, NPI, corp name (purple), supervisor line (green),
signature status. Short labels for license types: PSY, ACU, POD. No empty
line gaps between card fields (`gap-[3px]` + `m-0`).

### Dev test-data generator — real doctors/carriers/attorneys

`app/dev/page.tsx` `generate()` fetches real records from `doctors`,
`insurance_carriers`, and `lawyers` before generating patients. Falls
back to hardcoded fictional data only if a table returns empty rows.
No more "Yuri Goddesman" or fictional carriers/law firms in generated
test data.

### Wipe-patients endpoint — appointments cascade

`app/api/wipe-patients/route.ts`: `appointments` table now deleted before
`patients` in the cascade chain. Previous gap left orphaned appointment
rows pointing at deleted patients after a data wipe, causing broken
patient-name lookups on the Today Schedule.

## 2026-06-29 — Doctor location assignment Edit button, 12h time display

### Location Assignments — Edit capability (new)

- `app/admin/page.tsx` (`DoctorsSection`): added `editingLocId` state and
  `handleEditLocation(dl)` helper. Reuses the existing Add Location form
  and `handleAddLocation`'s upsert (`onConflict: 'doctor_id,location_id'`)
  — no new backend path needed.
- Each Location Assignment card now shows **Edit** alongside **Remove**.
  Edit populates the form with the assignment's existing values and
  opens it in edit mode.
- Location dropdown is locked (read-only display) while editing — only
  the schedule (days/hours/capacity/slot length) can change, not which
  location the assignment points to.
- Save button reads "Save Changes" in edit mode vs. "Assign Location" in
  add mode. Cancel resets `editingLocId` and the form back to blank.

### Location hours — 12-hour display format

- Location Assignment card time display (`{start_time} – {end_time}`)
  changed from 24-hour (`09:00 – 17:00`) to 12-hour with AM/PM
  (`9:00 AM – 5:00 PM`) via `toLocaleTimeString`. Display-only change —
  underlying `start_time`/`end_time` columns remain unchanged (still
  24-hour `time` type in Postgres).

## 2026-06-29 — Admin Users, Superadmin role, Visit conversion, RLS audit

### Admin Users Tab (new)

- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` — new API route, full CRUD via Supabase
  Admin client. GET lists all users (auth.users + user_profiles join).
  POST creates auth user + profile row with rollback on failure. PATCH
  handles profile edits, PIN reset, and active toggle. DELETE removes
  auth user (cascades to profile).
- `user_profiles.active` column added: `ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD
  COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true`
- `user_profiles` CHECK constraint updated to include `superadmin` role
- `lib/supabase.ts`: `padPin()` helper — pads PIN to 6 chars for Supabase
  Auth minimum password length requirement
- All test users reset to PIN `999999` via direct SQL on `auth.users`
- `UsersSection` fetch calls forward `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Superadmin Role (new)

- `app/page.tsx`: full rewrite in shadcn/ui + Oxanium. Three stages:
  `login` → `location` (MD) → `dashboard` (superadmin 2×2 picker)
- `ROLE_META` updated with `superadmin` entry (gold crown, dashboard picker)
- API route guard: non-superadmin cannot create/assign/modify/delete
  superadmin accounts. `getCallerRole()` reads Bearer token server-side.
- `user_profiles` CHECK constraint: added `superadmin` to allowed values
- Admin Users dropdown: `superadmin` added as selectable role

### Active Users KPI Card

- `OverviewSection`: `activeUserCount` state + fetch from `user_profiles
  WHERE active = true`. Replaces `—` placeholder.

### RLS Full Audit

Added `authenticated` role policies to all tables that had `anon`-only
coverage: `cpt_codes`, `doctor_locations`, `doctors`, `office_locations`,
`practice_settings`, `user_profiles`, `patient_pain_chart`,
`patient_procedures`, `patients`. Consolidated `patient_visits` and
`visit_line_items` to single `allow_all` policies covering both roles.

### Appointment → Visit Conversion

- `app/calendar/page.tsx`: `handleStartVisit()` — creates `patient_visits`
  row, marks appointment `Checked In`, navigates to chart with `?visit_id=`
- Role-based calendar buttons:
  - FD: View Chart · Confirm → · Check In → · No-Show · Cancel · Delete
  - MD: Start Visit (Checked In only) · No-Show/Cancel (Confirmed/Checked
    In only) · "Awaiting confirmation" text for Scheduled
- `app/md/[patientId]/PatientChart.tsx`:
  - `handleSave` dual-mode: UPDATE if `savedVisitId` exists, INSERT if not
  - `visitDirty` flag: detects empty pre-created visits vs saved visits.
    Initialized from visit data (`pce_data`/`cpt_codes` presence).
  - CPT/ICD-10 pickers gated on `(!visitDirty && savedVisitId)` — show
    pickers when dirty, read-only chips when already saved
  - Auto-complete: saves appointment as `Completed` when visit is saved
  - `canSave` simplified to `!tx.expired` (removed `!savedVisitId` gate)

### Booking Form Improvements

- Free-form time entry (`<input type="time">`) replaces slot system.
  NY No-Fault walk-in/queue model — exact time is administrative only.
- Double-booking guard in `handleBook`: blocks same doctor + date + time
- Dark doctor selector: locked MD shows as text, FD gets dropdown
- Hours hint below time input shows location service hours
- `generateSlots` retained but unused (available for future strict-slot
  practices)

## 2026-06-29 — Phase 4, union availability, location badge, Admin day blocking

### Scheduling Phase 4 — MD login location pre-filters calendar

- `app/calendar/page.tsx`: Phase 4 `useEffect` — after `doctorLocations`
  loads, jumps calendar to first available day for locked doctor+location
- `app/page.tsx`: `navigate()` stores `cosmos_location_name` in
  sessionStorage alongside `cosmos_location_id`
- `app/md/MDClient.tsx`: `📍 {locationName}` badge in green under heading
- `app/calendar/page.tsx`: `📍 {locationName}` badge under "Showing your
  schedule only"

### Union-of-locations availability

- `getDoctorLocs()`, `getAvailDaysForDoctor()` helpers added
- Grid/chips use union of all assigned location days (not just selected one)
- Capacity uses max across assigned locations when no location selected
- `isDayAvailable` guards on `doctorLocations.length === 0`

### Admin — blocked days in location assignment form

- Location Assignment day chips: days taken by other locations shown in
  amber with 🔒 and tooltip
- Default Schedule day chips: days assigned to any location shown in amber
- Location dropdown: removed filter hiding already-assigned locations

## 2026-06-29 — Scheduling Phase 3A, timezone fix, appointments RLS

### Scheduling Phase 3A — location-driven schedule (live)

Full implementation of Doctor → Location → Available Days → Time Slots flow.

**`app/calendar/page.tsx` — full rebuild:**

- `DoctorLocation` interface; `doctor_locations` fetched in `load()`
- `getActiveDoctorLoc()`, `getAvailDays()`, `getCapacity()`,
  `getLocationsForDoctor()` helpers
- Location picker above Time Slot
- Slot generation reads `start_time`, `slot_minutes`, `capacity`

### Timezone fix — `localDateStr()` helper

All `toISOString()` date-building calls replaced with `localDateStr(d)`.

### RLS — authenticated policies added to `appointments`

---

## 2026-06-28 — Auth foundation, Phase 3 location picker, RLS authenticated fix

### Authentication — full implementation

- `user_profiles` table (migration 012)
- 4 test users (PIN `9999` → now `999999`): fd, admin, billing, md
- `lib/supabase.ts`: auth helpers
- `app/page.tsx`: email + PIN login, location picker for MD
- `middleware.ts`: cookie-based route protection
- Sign Out on all dashboards

### RLS — authenticated role added to all tables

### Scheduling Phase 3 Option B — live

---

## 2026-06-28 — Admin dashboard expansion: Overview, CPT/ICD-10, Locations, Scheduling Phase 1+2

### Admin — Overview tab, CPT Codes + ICD-10 tabs, Providers improvements

### Database migrations

- `010`: `practice_settings` + `office_locations`
- `011`: `doctor_locations`; `appointments.location_id` FK
